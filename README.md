# Web-App-for-Environment-details
We have some working environment related details like Front-end Application link, Weblogic console link, Back-end credentials, front-end log path and backend-log path and many more . As the number of environments get increased, the maintenance of these details in the excel sheet is quite difficult and also not convenient. In order to collect all these details at one place , this web app is created which is scalable in case of environments. A new environment details can be easily added to be displayed in the app by putting the details in a text file having certain format and placing that file in the pre-configured path. This path can be configured at any time by modifying the configuration file.
